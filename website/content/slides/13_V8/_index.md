# Operator types (high to low level)

- JavaScript operators
  - Express semantics of JavaScriptâ€™s overloaded operators
  - Produce and consume effects in the graph
- Simplified operators
  - Express VM-level operations, such as allocation, bounds checks
  - Arithmetic independent of number representation
- Machine operators
  - Correspond closely to single machine instructions
  - Most are side effect free
  - Must be supported by platform-specific backends

---
# Operator types - examples

- JavaScript operators
  - JSAdd, JSBitwiseAnd, JSCall
- Simplified operators
  - NumberAdd, StringAdd, {Load|Store}Field, ChangeTaggedToInt32
- Machine operators
  - Int32Add, Float64Add, Load, Store, Call

---
# Some important reductions

- Constant folding
- Strenght reduction
- Load elimination
- Redundancy elimination
- Typed lowering

---
# Reductions

![Constant folding](/IPL/images/01-constant-folding.png)

---
# Type and range analysis

---
# Typed lowering

---
# Global value numbering (GVN)

---
# Function inlining

---
# Optimized code generation

---
# A simple types example - from JS to x86 assembly
